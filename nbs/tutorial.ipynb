    "Input volumes to the STAPLE filter must be binary segmentations of an image, that is, there must be a single foreground value that represents positively classified pixels (pixels that are considered to belong inside the segmentation). Any number of background pixel values may be present in the input images. You can, for example, input volumes with many different labels as long as the structure you are interested in creating ground truth for is consistently labeled among all input volumes. Pixel type of the input volumes does not matter. Specify the label value for positively classified pixels using SetForegroundValue. All other labels will be considered to be negatively classified pixels (background).\n",
